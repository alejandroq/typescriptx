# typescriptx

*Utility types for Typescript. Do you ever feel like avoiding the unit tests and letting the compiler validate your code for you? Is that an opinion held? Exploring that very question in my experimentation with Rust which Deno takes inspiration from (along with Go tooling).* 

## Result

The Result type is heavily inspired by Rust's equivalent.

## Runtime

Currently this repo only easily supports the Deno runtime as it's not fitted as a Node module. If given the time and interest, I may make this update.
